## Overview

A **cost-controlled** open-source project auditor. Before adopting a library, get a file/line-level risk ledger without trial-running it or force-feeding tens of thousands of lines into a frontier model.

Core: **tiered funnel + compute mismatch + ReACT scheduling**. Grunt work (structure extraction, coarse filtering) currently goes to zero-cost static parsing and deterministic local rules; heavy logic convergence goes to a frontier model; a ReACT state machine orchestrates the Reduce pass over deterministic findings. Ships as a single binary, zero-config, auditing a **whole project** or a **single module**. **sift itself must pass its internal release gates.**

## Project Profile (target state)

- **Zero-friction cold start.** `sift ./repo --scan-only` just runs; missing `~/.sift/config.toml` is created with non-secret defaults; no interactive prompts; exits with an injection hint if the key is missing.
- **Cost-controlled & budgetable.** The deterministic baseline is local; the large model only sees the deterministic findings when a full audit is requested, never the raw AST seed. `--benchmark` budgets from the Reduce prompts the audit actually sends (one per batch), measured against a mock endpoint to stay within 10% of what a provider bills.
- **Model orchestration.** A ReACT state machine chains deterministic findings and large-model convergence; skills are compile-time local functions.
- **Multi-model + concurrency.** Multiple endpoints are configurable; the scan fans per-file dehydration out over `concurrency` workers and consumes the results in walk order, and the independent Reduce batches overlap over that same cap (model side capped at 8). Both stages merge in index order, so streams and reports stay byte-stable; scan/model concurrency remains bounded and observable.
- **Never grind blindly.** Every external call has a hard timeout; repeated failures trip the breaker; on trip, back off / degrade or emit a partial report — never hang. The subprocess deadline also drains its pipes, so a child that produces a large report is never mistaken for a hung one.
- **Engineering-grade by default.** A clean-looking but incomplete audit is a defect. Any skipped input, truncation, fallback, partial model result, or invalid config must be visible and testable.
- **Stable machine contracts.** Scan JSONL, final Markdown, diagnostics, and generated reports have separate channels. Downstream scripts must be able to consume stdout without guessing whether it contains mixed formats.
- **Memory decoupled from scale.** Stream and drop; resident memory stays low. `--benchmark` reports the peak resident set on both supported platforms (procfs on Linux, `getrusage` on macOS), and the audit path measures a payload's size by counting its serialized bytes instead of materializing it.
- **Internally gated.** The project must pass its own maintainer-only release gates; modular, TDD-guarded, clear boundaries.
- **Priority on conflict:** robust > usable report > cheap > fast > small.

## Non-goals (hard rules)

- **No vector DB / embeddings / RAG.** For one-shot low-frequency audits, index upkeep costs more than prompt assembly; plain-text pipeline, read once and discard.
- **No runtime plugins / dynamic skills.** Skills = compile-time enum + match local fns; extend by editing and recompiling.
- **No service / Web UI / multi-tenant.** One-shot CLI only.
- **No process panics.** Dirty data dropped & logged; hallucinations/bad JSON tripped; Result/Option throughout, no unwrap/expect.
- **No unbounded blocking.** Any subprocess/network/model call must have a deadline.
- **Module audit must not balloon to global.** Cross-boundary refs marked and handed to the large model; no chasing.
- **No trial-run instead of audit.** Value is the pre-adoption verdict.
- **No scaffold masquerading as product.** Placeholders are allowed only inside explicitly unfinished phases; they must not produce reports that look production-complete.
- **No silent fallback.** Invalid config, truncated seed, skipped files, missing model roles, and degraded model paths must fail loudly or be shown in the report.

## Code Map

> Every `src/*.rs` carries unit tests; new subsystem ⇒ tests built alongside (TDD). Module boundaries are responsibility boundaries.

## Multi-model & concurrency (config schema)

```toml
concurrency = 8          # scan/model concurrency cap
[[model]]
role = "small"           # reserved for experimental Map diagnostics
endpoint = "..."
key_env = "SIFT_SMALL_KEY"
timeout_ms = 8000
max_retries = 1
[[model]]
role = "large"
endpoint = "..."
key_env = "SIFT_API_KEY"
timeout_ms = 60000
max_retries = 1
```
Resolve order: CLI key file > ENV > toml > default; no large key ⇒ exit. The current full-audit path does not call small-role models by default; missing small models do not change the deterministic-ledger Reduce path.
The default user config path is `~/.sift/config.toml`; it is created on first run from `config.example.toml`-equivalent defaults and must not contain raw secrets.

`concurrency` (default: available parallelism, hard-capped at 256 with a visible stderr note) sets the number of per-file scan workers. The walk itself stays single-threaded, and every worker result is re-ordered into walk order before it reaches stdout or the model seed, so `--scan-only` JSONL, agent-gate JSON, `sift query` truncation, and `sift surface` ledgers are byte-identical at any worker count.

The same cap bounds the model stage: independent Reduce batches run on up to `concurrency` workers (model side capped at 8, with a visible stderr note) and are merged in batch order, so a full audit's wall clock falls with the number of batches while the merged report stays byte-identical. Cloned clients share one transport and one atomic breaker, so concurrent batches stop together instead of each burning a separate retry budget.

## Timeout, breaker & recovery (never grind)

- **Per-call deadline:** time out and drop; no unbounded wait.
- **Breaker counter:** consecutive failures / bad JSON / unknown skill ≥ N ⇒ break, stop I/O.
- **Backoff recovery:** transient errors retry with exponential backoff to budget; non-transient degrade (small→AST, large→partial).
- **Budget cap:** global token/time ceiling; on hit, force-converge a `[TRUNCATED]` report.

## Engineering Contract

- A phase marked done must have behavior-level proof, not only type-level plumbing or happy-path unit tests.
- Full audit stdout is the final report stream. `--scan-only` is the JSONL stream. Diagnostics stay off stdout.
- Report coverage must disclose how much input was scanned, dehydrated, sent to models, skipped, or truncated.
- Config files are part of the trust boundary. Missing user config is auto-created from safe defaults; if a config file exists but is invalid, the process fails instead of reverting to defaults.
- Program source under `src/` is English-only for runtime text, prompts, and comments; bilingual documentation stays in docs.

## Phased Roadmap

> Each phase: feature list / boundaries / internal gate. All-green gate ⇒ next phase; next steps set by gate evidence.
> For a point-in-time done/partial/pending snapshot of every item below against real evidence, see [CHECKLIST.md](CHECKLIST.md).

### P0 Scaffold — done ✓
Features: clap fallback resolve, bounded scanner, exit on missing key, minimal wiring. Bounds: no net/parse/tree. Gate: `cargo build` green, 0 unwrap, `--scan-only` scans, missing key exit1.

### P1 Tier-0 AST dehydrate — done ✓
Features: tree-sitter Rust/Python/Go/JavaScript/TypeScript/HTML/CSS/Zig/Bash/Dart/Kotlin/Java/C/C++/C#/PHP/Swift/Ruby/SQL/Dockerfile/YAML/HCL/Vue/Svelte, extract sig/import/calls → flat AstSummary JSON; cross-boundary `[EXTERNAL_BLACKBOX]`; drop AST. Bounds: omit bodies/comments; tolerate malformed syntax without panicking and account for incomplete coverage in downstream reporting. Gate: 100MB repo memory stable & no crash; extract.rs tests cover typical+broken.

### P2 Model layer (multi-model + breaker) — done ✓
Features: ModelClient trait, registry, role routing; per-call timeout, breaker, backoff. Bounds: no cache/persist; keys env/file only, never logged. Gate: timeout/bad-response simulated, breaker trips; no plaintext keys.

### P3 ReACT scheduler — done ✓
Features: enum state machine, initial tool protocol prompt, large model emits `<TOOL_CALL>`, match-routes local skills via `$SEED`; retry≤N then partial. Bounds: compile-time skills, no dynamic load. Gate: bad JSON/unknown skill/N errors all trip; react.rs tested.

### P4 Deterministic Reduce+report
Features: deterministic AST coarse ledger, Markdown renderer, real `[[model]]` TOML parsing, explicit input coverage, stable JSON agent-gate output, policy controls, artifact inventory, eval corpus, and clean stdout boundaries. Bounds: module mode slices root only; truncation and degraded model paths must be visible. Gate: hits seeded risks; module/project don't bleed; full-audit stdout contains only the report; invalid config fails; fake-endpoint full audit smoke proves the user-facing path.

### P5 Internal Quality Gate — done ✓
Features: audit.rs scores trimmed dimensions and writes maintainer-only reports to `reports/` (gitignored). Gate: no FAIL/WARN for hard rules, including no broad dead-code allows, no Chinese source strings/comments, clean report stream boundary, and visible seed truncation.

### P6 Release hardening
Features: ReleaseSafe single binary, Makefile install path, macOS Homebrew tap publishing, more grammars, stable JSON. Gate: single-file dist, internal gates pass, docs↔code consistent, `brew install talkincode/tap/sift` backed by release checksums.

## Definition of done

- Zero-config run; `~/.sift/config.toml` auto-created; missing key exits with hint; never hangs.
- 100MB repo stable memory; no crash on dirty input.
- Report cites line numbers + cross-module deps + concurrency/resource risk.
- Report declares input coverage and truncation state; incomplete coverage never looks like a complete verdict.
- Every external call times out; failures trip to partial, never grind.
- One binary audits project and `--module` without bleed.
- Internal release gates have no FAIL or hard-rule WARN.

> Suggestions (not rules): rayon, exact timeout/size/latency numbers per benchmark. Hard rules: single binary, fallback resolve, bounded channel, hard-timeout breaker, no unwrap, TDD, bilingual docs (EN default, ZH twin), passing internal gates.
